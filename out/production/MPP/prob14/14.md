# Service A: Driver Location Updates
## Recommended Executor:
### Executors.newCachedThreadPool()

### Reasoning:
### Task characteristics:
- Each GPS update is a tiny, fast I/O-bound task (milliseconds).
- Highly variable load:
- Spikes during rush hour or events demand dynamic scalability.

### No need to cap concurrency:
- Tasks are short, so the risk of overloading CPU/memory is minimal.

### Cached thread pool benefits:
- Dynamically adds threads when needed.
- Reuses idle threads.
- Removes idle threads after a timeout (default 60 seconds), which saves memory during off-peak times.

### Summary:
- newCachedThreadPool() gives low-latency and high throughput for frequent, short-lived tasks with fluctuating volume.

# Service B: Ride Fare Calculation
## Recommended Executor:
### Executors.newFixedThreadPool(8) (or fewer based on load)

### Reasoning:
### Task characteristics:
- Each fare calculation is a heavy, CPU-intensive task (2â€“4 seconds).

### Server constraints:
- Only 16 cores, and the server runs other backend services.

### Avoiding CPU contention:
- A fixed-size thread pool ensures predictable concurrency, preventing too many simultaneous fare computations that could starve other services.

### Optimal utilization:
- Use a size like 8 to leave headroom for other workloads.
