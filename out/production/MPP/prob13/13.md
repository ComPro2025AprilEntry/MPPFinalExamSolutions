# Scenario 1: Real-Time Chat Server
## Recommended:
### Executors.newCachedThreadPool()

### Why?
- Burst scalability: newCachedThreadPool() can dynamically create new threads as needed. This is ideal for handling sudden spikes in message volume during peak times (like lunchtime).
- Short-lived tasks: Since each message takes less than 100ms, threads finish quickly and return to the pool.
- Avoid idle threads: Idle threads are removed after a timeout, keeping memory usage efficient.
- Non-blocking nature: Suitable for lightweight I/O or quick operations (e.g., message broadcast, logging).

### Risks mitigated:
- Thread churn is minimal because tasks are short.
- JVM can handle many threads if they're mostly I/O-bound or quick-running.

### Summary:
 - Use newCachedThreadPool() for high-throughput, bursty, short-lived tasks that must scale up rapidly without queuing.

# Scenario 2: Image Processing Service
## Recommended:
### Executors.newFixedThreadPool(8) (or fewer, depending on load characteristics)

### Why?
- CPU-intensive tasks: Image processing is heavy and CPU-bound; each task runs for seconds or more.
- Controlled concurrency: A FixedThreadPool with a limit (e.g., 8 for 8-core CPU) prevents the system from being overwhelmed.
- Prevents resource exhaustion: Limits the number of simultaneous processing tasks and avoids excessive context switching or memory pressure.
- Predictable workload: Since uploads are limited and predictable, there's no need for the pool to grow dynamically.

### Summary:
- Use newFixedThreadPool(coreCount) for CPU-heavy tasks where you want to cap parallelism and avoid system overload.
